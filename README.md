🔐 Image Encryption Tool – Step-by-Step Explanation
✅ Step 1: Start the Program
When you run the program, it displays a menu:

e to encrypt an image

d to decrypt an image

q to quit

✅ Step 2: Choose an Option
You type:

e if you want to encrypt an image

d if you want to decrypt an image

✅ Step 3: Enter a Key
You’re asked to enter a key (just a number).

This number is used like a "password" to lock/unlock the image.

✅ Step 4: Enter the Image Path
For encryption:

You give the full path of the image you want to encrypt.

For decryption:

You give the path of the previously encrypted image.

✅ Step 5: What Happens Inside
The program reads the image pixel-by-pixel.

It applies a mathematical operation using the key to modify each pixel.

This makes the image unreadable (encrypted).

The result is saved as a new file:

encrypted_image.png for encryption

decrypted_image.png for decryption

✅ Step 6: Output
After encryption, you get a message saying:

“Image encrypted successfully”

After decryption, you get:

“Image decrypted successfully”

✅ Step 7: Exit
You can type q any time to quit the program.

🧠 Summary
You encrypt an image using a key.

You decrypt it with the same key.

It works using pixel value manipulation.

The process is automatic after you provide the inputs.
